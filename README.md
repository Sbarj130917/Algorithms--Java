Single Source Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree Implementation

Implemented two graph algorithms mentioned below.

Problem 1:
Found the shortest path in undirected graphs for a given source node and printed out each path and the corresponding path cost after execution.

Problem 2:
In a given a connected, undirected, weighted graph, found a spanning tree using edges that minimizes the total weight w(T ) = ∑(u,v)∈T w(u, v). Used Kruskal algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Printed out the edges of the tree and total cost of the answer.
